## EaglercraftX Desktop Runtime
Desktop client for Eagler 1.8.8-u26. Like the web clients this has singleplayer on it. It is only meant for desktop (non-chromebook) users to use if the web clients lag too much.

To play this, you will need to download the repo and launch the jar file in the main directory to play. 

You need to have the latest java AND the latest JDK installed on your computer to run this. It will not run without JDK! (if it throws errors about lwjgl libraties not found its probably a JDK issue. Make sure you have it.) It might also be a problem with the actual dll and so files, but they should all be there.

This version may or may not work on Linux.
